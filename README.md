# HeaderFooter
If we need bottom bar only there is bottombarnavigation available in android,
if we need top bar then there is different options like tablayout etc.
but if we need both, and specially when one item should be selected out of all from top and bottom, then i did one alternate solution by using framelayout, relativelayouts and fragments, may be its useful for someone so i made this code available publicly.
